# Nofar-Kedmi-LLM-Classifier---Patient-Free-Text-Descriptions
For this project, we used ChatGPT to generate synthetic patient symptom descriptions.                                       The dataset includes a diverse range of symptoms, from critical conditions to common issues.   Each record contains a unique patient ID along with demographic details (age, gender, marital status).
