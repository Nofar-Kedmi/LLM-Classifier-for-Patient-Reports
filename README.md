# LangTriage

LangTriage is an NLP-based classification project that determines the urgency level of patients based on case descriptions generated from their clinical measurements. 

The goal is to analyze structured clinical data, transform it into natural language descriptions, and accurately and rapidly classify each case's urgency level (e.g., urgent – requiring immediate medical intervention, or non-urgent – can wait or be monitored). 
This process aims to Support faster and more consistent triage decisions. 



## NLP Tasks: 
* Text classification – Assign urgency labels to medical texts
* Data to Text Generation – from structured clinical data to symptom descriptions
