# Patient Free-Text LLM Classifier
For this project, we used ChatGPT to generate synthetic patient symptom descriptions.                                       
The dataset includes a diverse range of symptoms, from critical conditions to common issues.   
Each record contains a unique patient ID along with demographic details (age, gender, marital status). 

## Main objectives
* Text classification: Assign urgency labels to medical texts
* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify key symptoms, diagnoses, and risk factors
* Performance evaluation using precision, accuracy, recall, F1
